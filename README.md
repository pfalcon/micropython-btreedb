`btreedb` is a simple ORM-like wrapper for MicroPython's
[btree](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/unix/library/btree.html)
module.

Note that it's recommended to use the `btree` module directly, but if
you want to build an abstraction on top of it, `btreedb` may show an
example of doing that.

An example application where this module is used is
